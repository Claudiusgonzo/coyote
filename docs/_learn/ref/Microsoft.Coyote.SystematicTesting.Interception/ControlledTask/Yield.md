# ControlledTask.Yield method

Creates an awaitable that asynchronously yields back to the current context when awaited.

```csharp
public static YieldAwaitable Yield()
```

## Remarks

You can use `await Task.Yield()` in an asynchronous method to force the method to complete asynchronously. During systematic testing, the underlying scheduling strategy can use this as a hint on how to better prioritize this work relative to other work that may be pending.
